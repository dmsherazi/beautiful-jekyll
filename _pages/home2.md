[one_fourth] <strong>ABOUT THIS BLOG</strong>

I am using this platform to introduce myself as well as to keep sharing some snippets of codes regarding android , C++ , C , java , embedded Linux, arduino and so on, as well as some thing about circuits , micro-controllers or related software. I will also try to bring some topics or resources that I found hard to get on the world wide web. I am always ready to help (where I can) those who show some interest in learning.
