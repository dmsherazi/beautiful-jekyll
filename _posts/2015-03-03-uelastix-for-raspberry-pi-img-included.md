<a href="http://elastix.org/index.php/en/">Elastix</a>, the open source software for unified communications, has been ported to a number of ARM boards including the Raspberry Pi, the Asiri and the Pico-SAM9G45.

This flavour, called <a href="http://www.uelastix.com/">uElastix</a>, is a trimmed down version and differs significantly from the original Elastix.

uElastix gives you a trusted and tested asterisk based Elastix PBX on your Pi. But what makes it interesting is that it also gives you an alternative to the <a href="http://www.raspberry-asterisk.org/">RasPBX</a>. So, if you wanted a PBX on your Pi, you now have a choice.

A big let down for anyone wanting to try uElastix on their Raspberry Pi is that there is no readymade image file. There's just a 'How to Install' page which (a lot of people who tried it would agree) isn't very straightforward.

So, I decided to share this image I created. The image file requires a 8GB microSD card.
<h3>Download</h3>
The image file is ~7GB, I am uploading a winRAR compressed version . Use a suitable application to un-compress it after download. <strong>This will work with RapberryPi B+ and is not tested on Pi2 and Pi3</strong>
