The <a href="http://www.allwinnertech.com/en/clq/processora/A10.html">Allwinner A10</a> is a family of single-core SoC devices designed by Allwinner Technology from Zhuhai, China. Currently the family consists of the A10, A13, A10s and A12. The SoCs incorporate the ARM Cortex-A8 as their main processor and the Mali 400 as the GPU.

The Allwinner A10 is known for its ability to boot Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and other ARM architecture-capable distributions from an SD card, in addition to the Android OS usually installed on the flash memory of the device.

Here I am sharing the footprint for AllwinnerÂ A10 Soc chip taken from Olimex design.
