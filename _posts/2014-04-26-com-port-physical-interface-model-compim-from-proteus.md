I found an interesting feature from Proteus, so-called COMPIM serial port model. The Virtual System Modeling capabilities of Proteus VSM allow the creation of models that can actually interact with the physical world. Such models are called Physical Interface Models or PIMs for short.


The COMPIM model is a Physical Interface Model of a serial port. Incoming serial data is buffered and presented to the circuit as a digital signal, whilst serial digital data generated by a CPU or UART model appears at the PC's physical COM port. The physical COM part also includes virtual COM port over USB and Bluetooth with some work-around. The COMPIM model also provides for baud rate translation, and for optional hardware or software handshaking on both the physical and virtual sides of the device.


This allows any real world hardware equipped with a serial port to interact with a Proteus VSM simulation. For example, you could use it to develop a program for a microprocessor within Proteus VSM that would operate a real physical modem, perhaps as part of a security or home automation system. By default, the COMPIM supports 4 physical ports.
