The Raspberry Pi Foundation is likely to provoke a global geekgasm today with the surprise release of the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B: a turbocharged version of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/" target="_blank">B+</a> boasting a new Broadcom BCM2836 900MHz quad-core system-on-chip with 1GB of RAM – all of which will drive performance "at least 6x" that of the B+.

At its heart, though, is the BCM2836 SoC, which according to Upton has been in development for a couple of years. It's "very, very similar" to its predecessor – the <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/products/BCM2835" target="_blank">BCM2835</a> – but with four cores and "a little tweak to allow us to address the gig of RAM"

The BCM2835, as used in previous Pis, is a Broadcom GPU – the <a href="http://elinux.org/Raspberry_Pi_VideoCore_APIs" target="_blank">VideoCore IV</a> – with a single 700MHz ARM1176JZF-S application core glued in to run software. The system-on-chip is shipped with 256MB or 512MB of RAM stacked on top.

The new BCM2836, on the other hand, contains <a href="http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=v0LVywBi" target="_blank">four ARMv7 Cortex-A7</a> cores with 1GB of RAM.

The Raspberry Pi 2 Model B  is the latest version of the Raspberry Pi, a tiny credit card size computer. Just add a keyboard, mouse, display,power supply, micro SD card with installed Linux Distribution and you'll have a fully fledged computer that can run applications from word processors and spreadsheets to games.

<strong>What's the same:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Same form factor as the model B+ (your enclosures and daughter boards should still fit).</li>
	<li>Same full size HDMI port</li>
	<li>Same 10/100 Ethernet port</li>
	<li>Same CSI camera port and DSI display ports</li>
	<li>Same micro USB power supply connection</li>
</ul>
<strong>What has changed:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A new turbocharged  Broadcom BCM2836 900MHz quad-core system-on-chip with performance at least 6x that of the B+.</li>
	<li>1GB of RAM</li>
</ul>
